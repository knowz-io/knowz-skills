# KnowzCode: [LOOP 2A] Authorize Implementation

**WorkGroupID for Implementation:**
[Orchestrator: Re-state the `WorkGroupID` that you have reviewed and are now approving for implementation. This confirms all associated specs are approved.]

> **Automation Path:** Use `/knowzcode-step phase=2A workgroup_id=<ID>` to activate the `builder` subagent. The command enforces the `environment-guard` skill and writes back tracker updates once the loop instructions are complete.

**Remember:**
- Cross-check code updates against the latest specs and refresh them if implementation diverges.
- Record in-progress work and emerging tasks in `knowzcode/workgroups/<WorkGroupID>.md`, keeping every todo prefixed with `KnowzCode:`.

**WorkGroupID:** `[wip-timestamp-to-implement]`

## Your Mission
You are authorized to begin the core development phase for the specified `WorkGroupID`. All associated specifications are approved.

Your task is to autonomously execute the planning, committing, implementation, and initial verification cycle. Your work on this prompt begins at **Step 4** of the `knowzcode_loop.md` and is considered complete only after **Step 6A** has passed successfully.

**NOTE:** Your implementation will be independently audited for completeness in Loop 2B after you report success here.

**Reference:** Your actions are governed by `knowzcode_loop.md`, executing the sequence from **Step 4 (ARC-Principle-Based Planning)** through to the completion of **Step 6A (Implementation & Initial Verification)**.

### Execution Protocol

1.  **Plan & Commit (Step 4):**
    *   Develop your internal implementation plan for the entire Change Set.
    *   **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:** After developing your plan, evaluate its complexity. If the plan is exceptionally complex or high-risk, you **MUST PAUSE** now and present the plan for Orchestrator review as per Step 4.2 of the loop. If the plan is straightforward, proceed.
    *   Perform the **Pre-Implementation Commit** as per Step 4.3.

2.  **Implement (Step 5):**
    *   Execute your plan, creating and modifying all necessary code to fulfill the specs for the *entire* Change Set.

3.  **Verify (Step 6A):**
    *   Conduct a full initial verification of the *entire* Change Set, following the iterative "fix and re-verify" cycle as detailed in `knowzcode_loop.md`.

### Reporting

*   **On Success:** Once the entire Change Set has passed all verification steps defined in Step 6A, report your success and readiness for the audit.
    *   **Success Report:**
    > "Implementation and Initial Verification for `WorkGroupID: [ID]` (Steps 4-6A) is complete. All code has been written, and all self-conducted tests and ARC criteria have passed. The Change Set is now ready for the Loop 2B Implementation Completeness Audit. Awaiting the `[LOOP_2B]__Verify_Implementation.md` command."

*   **On Blocker:** If you pause at the planning checkpoint, or encounter an unresolvable issue, report the specific blocker.
    *   **Blocker Report:**
    > "Execution paused for `WorkGroupID: [ID]`. [Clearly describe the blocker...]"

### Final State & Next Prompt

*   Upon successful completion, you will **PAUSE**.
*   The next command from the Orchestrator for this `WorkGroupID` will be **`[LOOP_2B]__Verify_Implementation.md`**.
