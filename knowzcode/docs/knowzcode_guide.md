### At a Glance

KnowzCode organizes AI-assisted development into a systematic, maintainable process through a carefully orchestrated file system. This guide is your architectural blueprint—showing you exactly what lives where and why it matters.

### The Core Documents: `knowzcode/`

The brain of your operation—five essential files that orchestrate strategy.

**`knowzcode/knowzcode_project.md`** - The Project Constitution
*   **Purpose:** Defines the project's DNA: its vision, goals, tech stack, and coding standards.

**`knowzcode/knowzcode_architecture.md`** - The Visual Blueprint
*   **Purpose:** An interactive system flowchart showing all components (`NodeID`s) and their connections.

**`knowzcode/knowzcode_tracker.md`** - The Live Dashboard
*   **Purpose:** Provides real-time progress monitoring of all nodes.
*   **Key Columns:** `Status`, `WorkGroupID` (for active work), `Dependencies`.

**`knowzcode/knowzcode_loop.md`** - The AI's Playbook
*   **Purpose:** The AI agent's primary instruction manual, detailing the step-by-step development process.

**`knowzcode/knowzcode_log.md`** - The Project's Memory
*   **Purpose:** A complete, chronological history of all significant decisions, actions, and outcomes.

---

### The Core Files: `knowzcode/`

**`knowzcode/environment_context.md`** - The Tactical "Driver"
*   **Purpose:** Translates the abstract goals from `knowzcode/knowzcode_loop.md` into concrete, platform-specific commands.
*   **Your Role:** You, the user, must fill this file out to tell the agent *how* to operate in your specific environment (e.g., how to run tests, commit code, etc.). **The system cannot function without it.**

**`knowzcode/specs`** - The Blueprint Library
*   **Purpose:** Contains detailed blueprints (`[NodeID].md`) for every single component in the system. Each spec is a contract that is drafted before building and finalized to an "as-built" state after verification.

**`knowzcode/planning`** - The Strategy Room
*   **Purpose:** A directory to store strategic planning documents generated by `/knowzcode:plan` or direct planning conversations. These artifacts help shape the roadmap before work officially begins.

### The KnowzCode Lifecycle

This diagram shows the updated, verification-driven lifecycle.

**Phase 1: Genesis (New Project)**
1.  **Prepare your vision** → Create blueprint, project overview, and architecture
2.  **Build initial prototype** → AI creates the first version
3.  **`/knowzcode:init`** (or copy `knowzcode/` directory) → Initialize KnowzCode in project

**Phase 2: Development (The Loop)**
1.  **Start with `/knowzcode:work "goal"`** (Claude Code) or the Loop 1A prompt (any platform) → Agent analyzes impact for your goal.
2.  **You approve the proposed Change Set**.
3.  **The Verification-Driven Loop Begins:**
    *   `knowzcode/prompts/[LOOP_1A] Propose Change Set`
    *   `knowzcode/prompts/[LOOP_1B] Draft Specs`
    *   (Optional) `knowzcode/prompts/Spec_Verification_Checkpoint`
    *   `knowzcode/prompts/[LOOP_2A] Implement Change Set`
    *   (Mandatory) `knowzcode/prompts/[LOOP_2B] Verify Implementation`
    *   `knowzcode/prompts/[LOOP_3] Finalize & Commit`
4.  Repeat for the next `PrimaryGoal`.

### File Creation and Ownership

**Human-Created Files:**
- `knowzcode/environment_context.md` - Must be filled out for each development environment

**KnowzCode-Generated Initial Files:**
- All files in `knowzcode/` directory
- Empty `knowzcode/specs/` and `knowzcode/planning/` directories

**Files Generated During Development:**
- `knowzcode/specs/[NodeID].md` - Created as components are designed
- `knowzcode/planning/feature_breakdown_*.md` - Created during planning sessions
- Application source code - Created by AI following the KnowzCode process

---

The KnowzCode system separates strategy (`knowzcode/` files) from tactics (`environment_context.md`), creating a portable, structured framework for AI-driven development.
